# Rossmann stores - 6 weeks sales forecast

**Disclaimer**: this project was inspired by the "Rossmann Store Sales" challenge published on kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/c/rossmann-store-sales). It is a fictitious project but with all the steps of a real project.

## Business scenario
The sales director of the Rossmann stores wants to estimate the sales forecast for the next 6 weeks on its different units spread across Europe.

## Solution methodology
The resolution of the challenge was carried out following the CRISP (CRoss-Industry Standard Process for data mining) methodology, which is a cyclical approach that streamlines the delivery of value.
